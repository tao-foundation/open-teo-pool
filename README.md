### Features  

**This pool is being further developed to provide an easy to use pool for TEO miners. Testing and bug submissions are welcome!**

* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining
* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
* Failover miner instances: TEO high availability built in
* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
* JSON-API for stats
* PPLNS block reward
* Multi-tx payout at once
